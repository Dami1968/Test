Hi!
Here we are !
Let me introduce ! 
My name is Domenico, but my family and friends call me by my second name Damiano.
I have 2 daughters and I'm living in VÃ©troz (Valais). I like walking in mountains and cycling.
I worked for more than 20 years in a pharmaceutical company as an operator, programmer and project manager.
I created interfaces between analytical devices and applications on mainframes. 
During my studies I learned the C++ language mainly and some others that are not used anymore.
Today I work in an IT company that creates applications for municipalities integrated with archiving software. 
In this company, I worked for 7 years as manager for the infrastructure unit. 
Now I prepare, plan and follow up the installations for the software installation team.

I have always been passionate about data processing (acquisition, validation, compilation) by creating numerous reports, 
statistics and dashboards. Data analysis has always allowed me to improve and automate the processes of the company I worked for during 20 years.
Today, data is an important digital resource that has been collected by companies for many years, but unfortunately it is not exploited! 
Now, I don't find motivation in my job anymore, that's why I decided to follow several courses in order to improve myself 
in new fields such as machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence which are today fields 
where I will certainly find new interests and new work opportunities.
