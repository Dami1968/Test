Hi!
Here we are !
Let me introduce ! 
My name is Domenico, but my family and friends call me by my second name Damiano.
I have 2 daughters and I'm living in VÃ©troz (Valais). I like walking in mountains and cycling.
I worked for more than 20 years in a pharmaceutical company as an operator, programmer and project manager.
I created interfaces between analytical devices and applications on mainframes. 
During my studies I learned the C++ language mainly and some others that are not used anymore.
Today I work in an IT company that creates applications for municipalities integrated with archiving software. In this company, I worked for 7 years as manager for the infrastructure unit. 
Now I prepare, plan and follow up the installations for the software installation team.
